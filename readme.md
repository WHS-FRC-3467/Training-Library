# Training Library - Creating a Subsystem

Normally to start we would copy an existing subsystem template from the W8 library, but for learning purposes we will work to create a subsystem from scratch. 

## 1. Setting up the Structure

To start go ahead and create a folder under the subsystems folder and name it "flywheel"

Parent Folder: src\main\java\frc\robot\subsystems
Flywheel Folder: src\main\java\frc\robot\subsystems\flywheel

Inside of this folder, right click and create select "create new class/command" and select "empty class", name this *Flywheel*. Repeat this and create a second empty class called *FlywheelConstants*.
